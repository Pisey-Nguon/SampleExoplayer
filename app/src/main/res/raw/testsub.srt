1
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,209
Hurry up!

2
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,834
Look! It's Jupiter!

3
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,459
The largest planet in the Solar System.

4
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,126
Dad.

5
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:15,126
There is an eye on Jupiter.

6
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,584
That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

7
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,459
What's a windstorm?

8
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,959
Jupiter is like a huge balloon.

9
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,167
Composed of 90% hydrogen.

10
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,792
Grandpa, what's hydrogen?

11
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,292
What is hydrogen?

12
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,542
It's the fuel for Dad's rocket.

13
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,001
Hydrogen is

14
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,167
the fuel for Dad's rocket.

15
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,084
I see.

16
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,459
Liu Qi.

17
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,376
Yes?

18
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:39,959
A day may come

19
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,584
when you can see Jupiter without a telescope...

20
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,251
that's when dad will come back.

21
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,292
Where are you going?

22
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,626
Dad is going on a mission.

23
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,209
The most important mission in the world.

24
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,584
After I leave,

25
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,501
you'll be Liu Qi's only custodian.

26
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,501
You shall obtain the right

27
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,667
of underground city residency
without drawing the lots.

28
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:09,834
And it is the only way

29
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,709
to ensure that both you and Liu Qi

30
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,501
will survive.

31
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,376
This is the only choice--

32
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:21,417
That's enough. I get it.

33
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,584
Father.

34
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,626
Sorry.

35
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,126
At first

36
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,917
nobody cared about this disaster.

37
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,417
It's just another wildfire.

38
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,084
Another drought.

39
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,501
Another extinction of species.

40
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,209
Another vanishing city.

41
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:08,626
Until everyone is entwined with this disaster.

42
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:14,917
The Sun is rapidly degenerating and expanding.

43
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:19,334
The Sun will engulf Earth in 100 years.

44
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:24,751
The Solar System will
no longer exist in 300 years.

45
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,834
To face this coming cataclysmic catastrophe,

46
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,876
mankind united like never seen before.

47
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,084
In order to maximize the chance of human survival,

48
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:40,584
the United Earth Government
or the UEG decided to propel Earth out of

49
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,001
the Solar System to fly towards our new home
located 4.2 light years away.

50
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,667
This mighty and enduring

51
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,292
- human migration

52
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,126
- is named as the Wandering Earth Project.

53
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,167
Mankind will devote every possible resource

54
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,876
to construct 10,000 Earth Engines
on the planet's surface

55
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:02,167
to propel Earth out of the Solar System.

56
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,709
The height of every Propulsion Engine
is 11,000 meters.

57
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,792
They will provide a total
of 150 trillion propulsive force for Earth.

58
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:09,959
Salute!

59
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,084
The construction of Navigation Platform
International Space Station

60
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,001
will be completed early this month.

61
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,584
There are 311 Chinese senior pilots

62
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,001
- and 709 engineers that were selected.

63
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,959
Ignite.

64
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,334
Meanwhile,

65
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,792
to safeguard Earth's trajectory,

66
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,626
the United Earth Government consolidated
global astronautical capabilities

67
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:31,959
and spent 30 years to build the Navigation
Platform International Space Station.

68
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,459
The Navigation Platform
International Space Station will travel

69
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,376
with a relative position of 100,000 km to Earth.

70
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,501
It will provide warnings, navigations,
and communications for Earth.

71
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,792
Centrifugal drive activated.

72
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,334
Worldwide sea level will rise 300 meters within 10 years.

73
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,167
Haikou and Zhanjiang of our country
will be attacked by the tsunami first.

74
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,917
To deal with the continuous
deteriorating condition,

75
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,501
UEG constructed one adjacent city

76
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:06,084
beneath each Earth Engine.

77
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,709
Before Earth's arrival at its new home,

78
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,459
these will be the only refuge for mankind.

79
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,542
The right to underground residency
will be obtained by drawing lots.

80
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,709
The lottery result can't be transferred,
borrowed, or gifted,

81
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,876
till now. Mankind,

82
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,876
a tiny tribe in the Solar System,

83
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,542
will be embarking upon 2,500 years

84
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,084
- of wandering voyage.

85
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,876
The surface temperature will drop to
minus 70 degrees Celsius this year.

86
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,792
All surface residents from different

87
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,709
- Slowly.
- Don't push!

88
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,292
Dad will fly up into the sky

89
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,542
and turn into a star

90
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,417
to always watch over you.

91
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,376
Dad.

92
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,584
Are you really going to turn into a star?

93
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,126
Of course.

94
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,501
From now on, you just have to count.

95
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:14,834
Three.

96
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,542
Two.

97
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:18,501
One.

98
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,084
Look up!

99
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,667
You will see Dad.

100
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,292
Good bye, Solar System.

101
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,042
Good bye, Solar System.

102
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,459
Au revoir, systÃ¨me solaire.

103
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,376
Welcome to The Morning News.

104
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,084
Today's headlines are...

105
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,084
During the arrival of spring,

106
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:10,626
the first batch of personnel
on the Navigation Platform will be returning.

107
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:13,917
Completing 15 to 20 years of station duties.

108
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:18,876
All underground citizens of the globe
are eagerly anticipating their arrivals.

109
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,459
Therefore...

110
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:57,959
GRANDPA. I'VE DECIDED TO LEAVE.
DON'T WORRY. LIU QI.

111
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,417
Anticipating.

112
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,001
Spring breeze has arrived.

113
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,626
The spring is near.

114
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,251
The yearly planning starts with spring.

115
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,084
It's full of effort.

116
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,584
It's full of hope.

117
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,084
Tell us, monitor.

118
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,667
How do you define hope?

119
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:29,959
Hope is precious like a diamond for our time.

120
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,084
Hope is the only direction of our home.

121
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,792
Well said. Please seat.

122
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,292
Han Duoduo, do you have any thoughts?

123
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,084
I have nothing to say.

124
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,417
I just want to take a look outside,

125
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,459
but it's too dangerous out.

126
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,126
Xiao Ming, be seated. Class.

127
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,167
Don't panic. It's just a display malfunction.

128
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:52,584
Go. Let's go.

129
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,751
Xiao Ming, go back.

130
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,584
Stay in order.

131
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,167
Did you do this?

132
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,042
Shut up! Let's move!

133
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,126
Teacher.

134
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,167
Han Duoduo has run away!

135
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,751
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

136
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:10,542
Hu Kou. Committee is giving out dumplings tonight?

137
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,167
All you think about is food!

138
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,167
Where is Grandpa's vehicle pass?

139
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,001
I've got it.

140
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,334
Shall we grab the dumplings before we leave?

141
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:18,126
Eat dirt! Don't go then!

142
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,042
Liar!

143
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,376
You said you'll take me outside.

144
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,209
All personnel, return to your post.

145
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,292
Durian-flavored dried Earthworms!

146
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,042
What are you looking at?

147
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,417
It's just a day trip.

148
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,709
What's the rush?

149
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,959
That's what it is to you.

150
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,667
I'm not planning on returning.

151
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,209
Get moving!

152
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,459
Going nowhere without the suits.

153
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,459
You had the mahjong I needed,
why didn't you discard it?

154
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,917
Isn't bunny girl's

155
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,792
tail soft and sweet?

156
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,584
Aren't we meant to be each others' angel?

157
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,626
What are you doing here? It's the New Year!

158
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,084
How cheeky you are!

159
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,084
Hey.

160
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:03,667
Go.

161
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:05,959
Yi Ge.

162
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:09,959
Yi Ge.

163
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,417
Are the suits ready?

164
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,709
The stuff I want?

165
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,626
It's fairly new.

166
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:18,667
All checked.

167
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,959
Usable.

168
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,292
And I got you skewers too.

169
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,751
Eat while it is warm.

170
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,334
Good.

171
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,792
Grab your thermal suits.

172
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,126
How old are you?

173
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,334
Check out this tag Yi Ge made!

174
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,834
Just like the real thing.

175
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:02,334
Yours.

176
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,584
Thanks, Yi Ge.

177
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,042
Return the suits tomorrow.

178
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,376
Thanks. Yi Ge. See you.

179
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,167
Hurry up and move.

180
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,209
Didn't you say you are not coming back?

181
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,417
Wait.

182
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,167
Not coming back?

183
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:24,251
Are these all you paid me?

184
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,209
For two of my thermal suits?

185
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,959
Yi Ge, I'll make it up when I get back.

186
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,792
For years, I, Yi Ge, have been known

187
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,376
for honest trading only.

188
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,126
No credits given!

189
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,417
Yi Ge, I really need to go out today.

190
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,667
What for?

191
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,876
Just stay here with your sister for the new year.

192
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,542
Hey, boss, look!

193
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,126
Hyper?

194
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:54,542
You stinky repairman.

195
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,584
I dare you! Use it here...

196
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,292
Duoduo, get down.

197
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,626
I want him dead!

198
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,417
Dear friends.

199
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,376
Let's open the door and embrace the spring.

200
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,584
Joy shall follow you when you see one.

201
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,626
A New Year,

202
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,626
with our heads up and walking tall,

203
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,584
marching toward to the next spectacular chapter.

204
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,292
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

205
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,751
I dare you not to come back!

206
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,501
What?

207
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,209
Will they report us?

208
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,792
These were obtained illegally.

209
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,376
They'll expose themselves if they report.

210
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,501
Well...

211
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,959
This Spring Festival.

212
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,001
You will spend it with me outside.

213
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:15,376
Please check your thermal suit and helmet.
Please wait there.

214
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:25,084
Miss, can I chew gum with my helmet on?

215
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,501
- Chew what?
- Shut up and come over!

216
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:34,751
- In three days, we'll swing past Jupiter.
- Attention!

217
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:38,667
All transportation communication systems
must be turned on all the time.

218
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,542
Follow evacuation instructions at any time.

219
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:57,001
Please pay attention to reversing.

220
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,501
Oh, my.

221
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,584
Look at yourself.

222
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,209
Is it your first time outside, too?

223
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,042
Haven't you been outside before?

224
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,626
It wasn't this crowded last time.

225
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,501
You are such a liar.

226
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,376
How long will it take to get to the surface?

227
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,084
It's 5 km,

228
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,709
so at least 15 minutes.

229
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,709
Okay.

230
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,001
This is a communication device.

231
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,792
Press once to sync with the transporter.

232
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,167
Twice for regional broadcast.

233
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,584
Three times for the private channel.

234
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,584
Once outside,

235
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,042
stay close to me.

236
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,209
Don't run around.

237
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,417
Are you afraid?

238
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,584
Surface level reached.

239
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,667
All personnel, please be ready.

240
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,709
Let's go!

241
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,376
Enough looking around?

242
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:08,001
Let's go!

243
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,209
I sneaked out.

244
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,126
Am I getting expelled by the school?

245
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,876
Have you already been kicked out of your unit?

246
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:15,126
Nonsense.

247
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,709
Which one is Transporter 373?

248
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,042
Duoduo, come over!

249
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,042
- Give me grandpa's vehicle pass.
- Here.

250
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,501
Han Ziang,

251
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,126
senior driver.

252
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:41,167
Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division reminds you.

253
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,959
Routes are countless.

254
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,667
Safety is foremost.

255
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,626
With unregulated driving,

256
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,959
your loved ones might end up in tears.

257
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,126
Clutch.

258
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,834
Gear.

259
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:01,751
What the...

260
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,834
Can you drive, Hu Kou?

261
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,792
This transporter is not for everyone!

262
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,792
It requires at least five years of training.

263
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,667
I am genius enough just to make it move.
- Okay?

264
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,709
Genius.

265
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,376
Step on the clutch, hand on the gear, then move.

266
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,501
Heavy step, light hand and no commotion.

267
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,542
Watch out! There are others ahead!

268
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,251
Shit! Fuck!

269
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,584
Watch out!

270
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,042
The world outside is huge!

271
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:50,167
What are you yelling about? So embarrassing!

272
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,626
Such strong winds today.

273
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,626
Why are they mining these mountains?

274
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:55,876
For fuel.

275
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,042
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

276
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,709
Basically.

277
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,667
Basically, it's burning rocks.

278
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,251
The Earth Engine!

279
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,417
These are Propulsion Engines.

280
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,876
There are 10,000 of them around the globe,
made for pushing Earth forward.

281
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:10,417
This isn't the most gigantic one.

282
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,292
Those Torque Engines along the equator,

283
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,167
they are the real giants.

284
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,917
Synchronal translation is on.

285
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,334
Buddy.

286
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,084
Happy retirement.

287
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,209
One more day until I go home.

288
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,584
Don't mess up my last dignity.

289
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,584
Save this moonshine for yourself.

290
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,584
I will store it somewhere safe for you.

291
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,626
Save it for your farewell party.

292
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,209
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.

293
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,417
Don't you know

294
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:08,709
how vodka was smuggled up
during Gagarin's time?

295
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,917
We'll be entering Jupiter's orbit today, right?

296
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:27,542
Yes, we have already stood by for
Emergency Protocol No. 3.

297
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,001
Something doesn't feel right.

298
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,417
There's no other way. Earth can't

299
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,042
leave the Solar System
without utilizing Jupiter's gravity.

300
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,501
It is a risk we must take.

301
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,834
God will bless us.

302
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,584
Once this is over, you can return home.

303
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,501
It's the last procedure for daily inspection.

304
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,251
Check the Centrifugal Drive Control unit.

305
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:48,501
Record the temperatures
of Centrifugal axle bearings.

306
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,626
Understood.

307
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:05,209
Liu Peiqiang has completed handover procedure.

308
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,792
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

309
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:07,834
Until today,

310
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,709
you have accumulated a resting time
of 12 years and 3 days in total.

311
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,584
An accumulated shift of 5 years and 14 days total.

312
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,167
We are grateful for your contributions
for the past 17 years.

313
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:19,376
Congratulations on your duty completion
and journey home tomorrow.

314
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,584
Brother.

315
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,959
See you on Earth three years later.

316
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,292
Go catch up with your son.

317
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,626
You haven't spoken to him for almost a decade.

318
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,709
See you on Earth.

319
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,584
Bro.

320
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,959
You'll be spending
the next three years with me now.

321
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,251
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.

322
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,751
Earth's trajectory is off course by 9.23 degrees

323
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,959
due to Jupiter's gravitational spike.

324
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,042
The probability of colliding
with Jupiter increases.

325
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,709
Analyzing data collected.

326
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,792
Transmitting to the UEG.

327
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,959
Disaster warning protocols activated.

328
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:52,959
There's a supply depot 50 km ahead.

329
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,084
Once we get there,

330
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,542
you go back by yourself.

331
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:01,834
Catch the earliest shuttle back

332
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,792
so grandpa won't worry about us.

333
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,584
Oh, come on.

334
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,584
You would be clenched by the collar
once your dad gets back.

335
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:12,376
I'm a genius. No one is capable of clenching me.

336
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:13,917
What the...

337
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,292
Car inspection.

338
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,542
How did you get in here?

339
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:19,459
Unregulated...

340
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:20,667
Unregulated driving.

341
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,667
Unregulated?

342
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,917
You committed thievery!

343
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,376
I didn't steal. I just borrowed it.
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.

344
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:28,459
Nonsense. All transporters belong to
the UEG as public properties.

345
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,584
It's not up to your grandpa!

346
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,001
What are you doing?

347
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:34,876
It's way past bedtime!

348
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,001
Sir.

349
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:38,626
I'm just getting to know new friends.

350
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,876
More friends, more options.

351
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,459
Hand over.

352
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,917
You think it is yours?

353
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,667
Hit the sack.

354
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:48,959
Have a nice stroll.

355
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,792
I am Tim.

356
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,626
My dad is from Beijing
and my mom is from Melbourne.

357
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:55,542
A Chinese and Australian joint product.

358
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,959
Come on, I was just joking.

359
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,292
Let's shake hands?

360
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,417
Hello.

361
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:04,834
Joint product.

362
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,209
It hurts. Let go of me.

363
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,126
It hurts!

364
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,584
Name of the visitor?

365
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,542
Han Ziang.

366
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,376
I'm here for my grandson.

367
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,042
Someone's getting bailed.

368
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,709
Sir.

369
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,626
My grandson is a mechanic trainee.

370
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,126
He just wanted to touch the real thing.

371
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,501
May you go easy on him.

372
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,376
Transporters are highly valuable public property.

373
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:06,001
Lending out your vehicle pass privately
is also a serious offense.

374
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,917
This is good stuff.

375
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,209
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

376
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,126
It's all in.

377
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,251
Oh, well.

378
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,626
Same old trick.

379
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,584
Stop wobbling, old man!

380
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,501
What old man?

381
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,584
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

382
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,501
Running away from home.

383
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,209
You're too old to be running away.

384
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:56,167
He is your father anyhow.

385
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,376
Where are you going to hide?

386
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:58,751
You even brought your little sister out?

387
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:01,042
Outside is dangerous!

388
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:02,792
And you!

389
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:07,042
You've learned to steal!

390
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:09,876
You stole my pass!

391
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:12,001
Should you do whatever
your brother told you to do?

392
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,584
Are you dumb?

393
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,042
I didn't intend to bring her along.
But she was begging me--

394
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,542
As a brother...

395
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,292
to take her.

396
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:20,792
Liu Qi! You liar!

397
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,126
Here she goes again.

398
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,792
Nicely said!

399
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,459
Ignore senior's advice--

400
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,042
Mind your own business!

401
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,126
Don't take it out on the wall.

402
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,334
Take it out on me if you dare.

403
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,376
What the...

404
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:40,334
Earthquake!

405
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,626
Shi San Yao!

406
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:42,959
I won!

407
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,542
Open the door!

408
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,126
Anyone?

409
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:03,584
Open the door!

410
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,334
Here!

411
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,834
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- Here!

412
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:14,501
Warning.

413
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,709
Earth Engine system failing.

414
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:19,626
Total, 121 facilities.

415
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:20,667
Correction.

416
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,334
1,112 facilities.

417
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,209
Correction.

418
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,334
3,319 facilities.

419
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,167
Don't leave me!

420
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,709
Help! Is anyone there?

421
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,917
My mom needs me and my kid...

422
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,834
I don't even have a kid yet!

423
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:35,959
Hey!

424
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,709
Please help me, man.

425
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,209
- Hu Kou.
- Come on.

426
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,959
- Hu Kou, come back.
- Come here.

427
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,084
Grab the key.

428
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,501
The key! The key is pinned underneath.

429
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,917
What's this? You can't pull this apart!

430
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,084
Hurry up!

431
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,042
Wait for me.

432
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,501
Engine No. 7 has stopped.

433
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,209
Engine No. 3 has stopped.

434
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:27,917
Get the chief engineer! Quick!

435
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,709
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike,

436
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,667
Earth's propulsion has been halved.

437
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,542
Torques lost completely.

438
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,251
In 37 hours 4 minutes 12 seconds,

439
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,084
the Earth will collide with Jupiter.

440
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:51,042
Han Ziang, senior driver.

441
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:54,084
Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division reminds you.

442
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,751
Routes are countless.

443
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,792
Safety is foremost.

444
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,417
With unregulated driving,

445
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,876
your loved ones might end up in tears.

446
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:02,292
Shut up, stupid!

447
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,376
Move it!

448
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,834
Hu Kou! Detach!

449
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,334
Hu Kou!

450
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:49,126
I feel dizzy.

451
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:20,792
Top priority from UEG,

452
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,501
to all standby forces on Earth.

453
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,167
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike,

454
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:28,417
a total of 4,771 Earth Engines
have shut down globally.

455
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,959
To avoid collision with Jupiter,

456
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:33,251
every unit must execute Emergency
Protocol No. 3 and depart immediately.

457
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:37,501
It's imperative to restart
all malfunctioning engines within 36 hours.

458
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,584
This rescue mission

459
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:42,167
concerns the survival of 3.5 billion human lives.

460
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,959
This mission is to be above all else,

461
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,876
at any cost.

462
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:53,667
Rescue units are on the go!

463
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:57,709
In order to expedite the rescue,
all resources will be consolidated.

464
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:01,292
The space station will be
implementing a low consumption mode.

465
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,417
Lisa, low consumption mode implemented.

466
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,709
Regular communication services
will be cut off shortly.

467
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:06,667
Low consumption mode activated.

468
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:07,667
I just got here.

469
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,667
How could I know about hibernation?

470
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,667
MOSS, please contact my relative.

471
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:13,667
Contact Liu Qi.

472
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,667
Liu Qi isn't in the allocated living area.

473
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,876
Connection failed.

474
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,959
MOSS. Contact transporter driver Han Ziang.

475
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,376
Incoming connection.

476
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:34,084
Peiqiang? Is that you?

477
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:35,709
Father. It's me.

478
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,209
Have you seen Liu Qi?

479
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,417
Liu Qi is right here with me.

480
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,584
We just ran into an earthquake.

481
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:43,042
We are on the outside surface now.

482
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,042
MOSS. Locate the transporter

483
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,417
and guide it to the nearest refuge center.

484
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,251
What's there to say to him?

485
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:52,251
Transporter 373. Driver Han Ziang.

486
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:55,626
Please proceed to Jinan No. 5 refuge center.

487
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,584
Space station flight configuration completed.

488
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,334
All personnel, enter hibernation
for energy conservation.

489
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:11,542
Hibernation rate at 77.3%.

490
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,209
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang,

491
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:16,126
please proceed towards hibernation unit quickly.

492
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:20,584
Low consumption mode activated.

493
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:24,917
Consolidation of all resources to
expedite global rescue mission.

494
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:29,667
Initiating global surface scan
and complete network coverage.

495
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,209
What's this?

496
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:44,959
Emergency communication
authorization code of Liu Qi's dad.

497
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,876
It's a direct line to the space station.

498
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,626
Transporter 373.

499
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:51,876
Please slow down and stop.

500
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,876
Await for further instructions.

501
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,167
Transporter 373,
stay still and await instructions.

502
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,376
Hey!

503
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:21,792
Transporter 373.

504
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,042
This is an emergency requisition.

505
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,417
Stop now!

506
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,959
Transporter 373.

507
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,417
Stop now!

508
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,959
I swear.

509
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,001
That girl from the day before.

510
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,167
She was totally voluntary!

511
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,292
Shut up!

512
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,834
They are not here to take you back.

513
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,584
We are rescue team, unit CN171-11,

514
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,959
assigned to aim for Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.

515
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:12,084
In accordance with The Wandering Earth Act,
Article 32, Section 1,

516
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,584
your transporter and crew

517
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,876
have been requisited.

518
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,959
To save the cargo container,

519
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,459
their driver decoupled his transporter
and went down the crevasse.

520
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:27,459
and sacrificed himself.

521
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:29,376
What's inside?

522
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,459
What could be that important?

523
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,584
Boss! Cargo container has been reloaded.

524
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,959
Engineers, check on the Lighter Core.

525
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,459
Zhou Qian, reorganize the transporter crew.

526
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,834
- Move out as soon as possible!
- Roger that.

527
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:40,959
Lighter Core.

528
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:44,251
Isn't that the Earth Engine's trigger device?

529
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,209
No Earth Engine has shut down
for the past 30 years.

530
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:51,209
It's not just a simple rescue mission.

531
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:52,834
A lot of people will die.

532
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:55,251
Boss! Lighter Core self-check completed.

533
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,709
Everything is normal.

534
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,667
Please assist sub-mission 1125.

535
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,001
Deliver the Lighter Core

536
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,042
and restart Hangzhou Earth Engine.

537
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,376
Clear the road.

538
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,834
Let the team with the Lighter Core pass first.

539
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:34,834
Captain Wang from unit 171-11.

540
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,126
Our destination is Nanjing.

541
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:37,709
Don't wait for us, please move forward.

542
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:39,542
Copy that. Wish you the best.

543
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,042
Unit 171-01,

544
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:50,709
we're entering Shanghai area.

545
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:52,292
Report road status.

546
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,584
Tectonic plate movements sourced in Shanghai area.
Proceed with caution.

547
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,084
Roger that.

548
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,917
Boss! Look!

549
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,709
Our home.

550
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,917
What happened to it?

551
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:18,376
Liu Zi, report 171's locations.

552
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,959
Unit 06's signal was last received at Cangzhou.

553
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,417
Units 09, 13, and 15 signals
were last received at Huaian.

554
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,334
Other units have made it to Shanghai area

555
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,042
and are on their way to Hangzhou.

556
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:29,209
- Boss.
- You guys go take a look.

557
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,251
- Roger that.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,084
Liu Zi, scout.

559
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:02,751
Our team is up ahead,
distance estimated 80 km.

560
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,834
Follow the crevasse.

561
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,876
We should rendezvous within an hour.

562
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:11,751
This place looks unstable.
Pass through as soon as possible.

563
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:15,001
- Load up. Move out.
- Roger.

564
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,334
Engineer team, stay alert.

565
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,167
This is unit 171-11.

566
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,209
We have entered Shanghai area.

567
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,417
Unit 11, be alert.
We've received a distress signal.

568
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:37,417
- Please check the surrounding environment.
- Copy that.

569
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,001
01. 01. Collapsed subway ahead.

570
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,542
Please detour.

571
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,751
Copy that.

572
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,126
Duoduo.

573
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,126
Don't be afraid.

574
00:38:04,126 --> 00:38:06,251
This was Grandpa's home.

575
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,042
Look at those tall buildings.

576
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:12,584
A lot of people used to live there.

577
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:14,792
Back then,

578
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,709
no one cared about the Sun.

579
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:21,834
Everyone was concerned
about the thing that is called money.

580
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,959
Grandpa couldn't make a lot of money back then.

581
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,584
But I was happy every day.

582
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,001
Especially on my way home.

583
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:34,376
I could always smell your grandma's cooking

584
00:38:34,376 --> 00:38:37,584
from far away.

585
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:42,459
Actually, she could barely cook

586
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:44,917
except for the scallion noodles.

587
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,042
I tell you,

588
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,417
Her scallion noodles

589
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,917
are incredibly salty.

590
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,667
But I slurped it all up,

591
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,167
cleaned my bowl every time.

592
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,001
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

593
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,751
Lieutenant Colonel Makarov.

594
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:03,584
Please initiate hibernation mode
as soon as possible.

595
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:04,959
Don't worry,

596
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,584
your son will be safe.

597
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:20,126
MOSS.

598
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:21,917
Where is Liu Qi now?

599
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:25,917
Why are they in Shanghai?

600
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:27,667
Transporter 373

601
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,626
has been integrated into the rescue mission

602
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,542
on their way to Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.

603
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:35,667
Who's in command?
Request to connect with the commander.

604
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,251
Incoming connection.

605
00:39:40,251 --> 00:39:41,417
Captain Wang Lei.

606
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,667
This is the space station.

607
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,751
I am astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

608
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,501
Hello, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

609
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,376
I'm the unit commander for CN171-11.

610
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:50,751
Please instruct.

611
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:51,751
Captain Wang Lei.

612
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:52,792
Within protocols,

613
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,292
please resettle the civilians

614
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,334
into the nearest underground city quickly.

615
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:57,834
Lieutenant Liu Peiqiang.

616
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,709
We have an urgent rescue mission.
Thanks for your understanding.

617
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,376
I'll resettle the civilians
at the Jiaxing refuge center,

618
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,959
but the transporter
has a special operating system.

619
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,626
We need driver Han Ziang to stay.

620
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,167
Over.

621
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:13,584
Captain Wang Lei.

622
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,001
This is a dangerous rescue mission.

623
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:16,792
- Please ensure the safety of Han Ziang.

624
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,292
- I stay! I can drive this transporter, too.

625
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,959
When we arrive at Jiaxing,
let Grandpa and the others get off.

626
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,459
You can operate shit.

627
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:30,751
Just follow the orders!

628
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:33,667
Captain Wang Lei, he is still a kid.

629
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,459
He is not capable--

630
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,876
What rights do you have to make decisions for me?

631
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,209
My mom's death

632
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:42,917
was your decision.

633
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,792
Liu Qi, what are you talking about?

634
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,251
Am I wrong?

635
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,209
After I left,

636
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:55,626
only one custodian can accompany
Liu Qi into underground city.

637
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:59,251
She's gravely ill, she won't hold up much longer.

638
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,876
Giving up on the treatment.

639
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,542
This is the only way to ensure
both of you and Liu Qi

640
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,584
can survive.

641
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,209
That's enough. I get it.

642
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,834
So be it.

643
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:19,792
Father.

644
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:24,751
Sorry.

645
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,417
Mayday!

646
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:33,167
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.

647
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:34,376
We are unable to maintain airborne.

648
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:36,501
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.
We are unable to maintain airborne.

649
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:40,251
Air force rescue unit CN114-03. Force landing!

650
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:45,834
Mayday!

651
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,542
Atmospheric pressure is dropping.

652
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:49,834
MOSS, what's the status on Earth?

653
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,751
Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.

654
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:54,834
All surface communications
in Shanghai area were lost.

655
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,626
All alert!

656
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:01,334
An object is crashing to our rear!

657
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,376
MOSS,

658
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:06,917
report surface status!

659
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,834
Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike,

660
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:11,334
the Earth is experiencing global aftershocks.

661
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:15,542
Tectonic plates are fracturing in Asia and Pacific.

662
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,417
The glass...

663
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:32,792
The glass is going to crack.

664
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:34,709
Oh, my God!

665
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,959
Am I going to die here?

666
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:38,751
Death is normal.

667
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,834
What?

668
00:42:42,376 --> 00:42:45,001
All units! Helmets on!

669
00:42:52,751 --> 00:42:54,042
What are you doing?

670
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:56,626
Let go!

671
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:57,917
Go away!

672
00:42:58,626 --> 00:42:59,959
Let go!

673
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:01,584
Two hundred meters ahead!

674
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:03,126
Collapse alert!

675
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,126
Full speed reverse!

676
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,084
Move!

677
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:16,834
Move!

678
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,167
Extreme turbulences at Earth's atmosphere.

679
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:34,001
Global disaster loss assessment completed.

680
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:36,209
Point formation flight terminated.

681
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:38,876
Loading evacuation procedures.

682
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:41,334
What? Evacuation?

683
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:44,042
MOSS, connect me to UEG.

684
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,167
Hibernation gas releasing.

685
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,334
Evacuation procedure. Hibernate immediately.

686
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:54,459
MOSS, open the cabin!

687
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:55,917
Open the cabin, MOSS!

688
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,917
MOSS, open the cabin!

689
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,542
This is defection!

690
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:23,251
Help!

691
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:24,751
I don't want to die here!

692
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:27,542
Help!

693
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,584
Didn't you say death was normal?

694
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:36,209
Help!

695
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:37,376
Boss.

696
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,959
We've lost contact with the other units.

697
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,459
I can't reach them!

698
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:42,126
Da Gang, transport the Lighter Core with me!

699
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,251
Chui Zi, Ya Tou, save the others.

700
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:44,001
Liu Zi, find a way out!

701
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:44,917
Everyone, abandon the vehicle!

702
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:45,959
Yes!

703
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:49,917
Go!

704
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,876
Get in!

705
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,584
Quick! Get in, quick!

706
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,209
Help!

707
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:04,334
What's going on?

708
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,209
How are you guys doing?

709
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:07,626
- Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
- Hurry up!

710
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:15,792
Normal.

711
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:18,417
Old man, quick on feet.

712
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:31,542
Boss, the Lighter Core is in good condition.

713
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:37,626
Still hauling this damn ball now?

714
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:39,751
Among all the Lighter Cores
that were meant for Hangzhou,

715
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:41,917
This is the last one.

716
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,751
We've lost all our units.

717
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:45,876
This Lighter Core is Hangzhou's only hope.

718
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,542
Nice speech.

719
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,501
But what about the two kids here?

720
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,209
Boss, this building looks intact.

721
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,667
We can try to climb up from inside.

722
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:08,667
Good.

723
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,626
Let's get the Lighter Core out now.

724
00:46:42,251 --> 00:46:45,876
- Liu Zi, find a way out.
- Roger.

725
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,876
Gang Zi. Zhou Qian. Load the Lighter Core.

726
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,209
Hold on.

727
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:05,501
Load people first.

728
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,209
Load

729
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,126
people.

730
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,751
Stop wasting time.

731
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,792
Load the Lighter Core and people together!

732
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:23,792
Slow down.

733
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:25,959
I have acrophobia.

734
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:35,667
Boss. I found an opening.

735
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:38,709
We can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling.

736
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:46,376
Chui Zi. Liu Zi. Whoever here! Make a way out!

737
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,501
Ya Tou, you take over.

738
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:01,876
Hu Kou! Grandpa!

739
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:03,209
Hurry up!

740
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,709
Gang Zi, report the position of the Lighter Core.

741
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,792
50th floor. Below Han Ziang!

742
00:48:15,584 --> 00:48:17,126
Here it is!

743
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:18,917
Right here! The thinnest part!

744
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:19,959
Thin? What thin?

745
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:22,084
- I'll leave this to you.
- Okay.

746
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:46,917
The pulley can't hold longer.

747
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:47,917
Pull up the Lighter Core.

748
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:49,376
Are you okay, old man?

749
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,126
Leave me! Go up quickly!

750
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:58,667
- Go up quickly.
- Wang Lei! Pull my grandfather up!

751
00:48:59,584 --> 00:49:01,667
Gang Zi. Position.

752
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:05,084
Lighter Core is now on the 75th floor.

753
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,959
Quick!

754
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,209
Old man!

755
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:33,667
Get up here, you old man!

756
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:46,251
Wang Lei, I can't hold it any more!

757
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,917
Old man!

758
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:10,709
Let me go, kid.

759
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:16,626
Grandpa!

760
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,917
Gang Zi!

761
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:39,376
Boss.

762
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,834
Gang Zi is gone.

763
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:09,917
Stop dazing.

764
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:11,084
Han Ziang is gone.

765
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,667
Get them two out of here.

766
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:14,584
Liu Qi.

767
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:19,001
- Duoduo, let's move.
- Liu Qi.

768
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,417
Hu Kou.

769
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:24,584
Hu Kou.

770
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,376
Are you and Duoduo

771
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,709
- safe?

772
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:32,584
Old man.

773
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:33,751
Let's go.

774
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,292
Where are you, old man?

775
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,667
I'm coming to get you.

776
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,584
Grandpa.

777
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:42,917
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

778
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:57,292
Hu Kou, save Grandpa!

779
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,042
Liu Qi, you save Grandpa!

780
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,292
Where are you, old man?

781
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:05,084
OXYGEN: 1%

782
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:38,584
On the 17th day after the Earth stopped spinning,

783
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:41,542
I saved a child.

784
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:47,084
She was handed over to me by countless hands.

785
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,667
I don't know who her parents were.

786
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:56,667
Every soul under the water

787
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:59,626
is her mother and father.

788
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:05,626
I named her Han Duoduo.

789
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:10,084
I named her after my daughter.

790
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:10,709
Grandpa!

791
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:12,751
I am so sorry, old man.

792
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,917
My grandchildren.

793
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,709
- Don't be afraid.
- Come up now!

794
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:16,709
From then on,

795
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:19,376
we are a family.

796
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:31,626
Hu Kou.

797
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,751
As a brother,

798
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,042
you have to watch over your sister.

799
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:41,792
Take Duoduo home.

800
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:54,459
Grandpa!

801
00:53:54,459 --> 00:53:55,834
Duoduo.

802
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:57,501
- It's dangerous.
- Duoduo.

803
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,542
- Step back.
- Duoduo.

804
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,084
Why didn't you save my grandpa?

805
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:13,459
This is our fate!

806
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,251
Let my brother go!

807
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:17,584
Duoduo.

808
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,626
- Chui Zi, Ya Tou, take them away.
- Roger.

809
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:26,626
Don't touch her.

810
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:28,834
Duoduo, it's dangerous.

811
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,209
Stop moving.

812
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,334
You will both freeze to death here!

813
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,417
I'm not leaving with you.

814
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:38,626
I'm going home with my brother.

815
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:41,376
Boss, if we march to Hangzhou at full speed,

816
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:43,292
it should take us three hours to get to Hangzhou.

817
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,584
The transporter is gone.

818
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:50,542
I'm no use to you anymore.

819
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,167
Leave them with the backup supplies
and a military navigation!

820
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:57,834
Let's move!

821
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:59,334
Hangzhou awaits.

822
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:01,251
Duoduo, let's go home.

823
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:05,876
Grandpa is gone.

824
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:09,459
Where is our home?

825
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:31,292
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

826
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:33,542
Hibernation mode compromised.

827
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:37,042
Warning. Unauthorized awakening.

828
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,542
Hibernation mode compromised.

829
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,709
By the contingency regulations,

830
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:06,542
activating manual rectification procedure.

831
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:10,876
Awakening personnel of unit H-7X01.

832
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,584
Lieutenant Colonel Makarov.

833
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:18,209
Lieutenant Colonel Hamdan.

834
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,626
According to contingency regulations,

835
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:23,001
please rectify accidental awakening.

836
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:26,126
Incident No. H-71.

837
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:28,501
According to contingency regulations,

838
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:30,834
please rectify accidental awakening.

839
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,501
Incident No. H-71.

840
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,334
Liu Peiqiang.

841
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:39,334
What are you doing?

842
00:56:39,334 --> 00:56:40,459
The space station has ran off track!

843
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:42,501
Earth's communications will soon be paralyzed.

844
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:44,959
People on Earth are abandoned.

845
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:46,501
My son is still out there!

846
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:48,251
Have you lost your mind? Because of your son?

847
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:50,209
We're in low consumption mode.

848
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,584
You will be handed over to the military court!

849
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:54,501
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

850
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:55,876
See it for yourself.

851
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,209
Perhaps MOSS is malfunctioning.

852
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,834
It's defection!

853
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:06,667
What are you planning to do?

854
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:10,209
Head to the central control module.
Stop the space station.

855
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:14,792
Will all violators

856
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:16,917
stop contact immediately with Earth

857
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:19,376
and return to the hibernation area?

858
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:24,876
Liu, are you sure we have to go via this airlock?

859
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:28,501
Makarov, maybe you shouldn't come with me.

860
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:30,417
You won't make it without me.

861
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:34,334
Do you think you know the exterior like I do?

862
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:35,209
Don't forget...

863
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,209
We Russians invented space station 100 years ago.

864
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,167
The airlock isn't designed for exiting.

865
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,334
Are you sure this is going to work?

866
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:48,084
I'm sure.

867
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:51,959
We want to take our kids

868
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:53,792
to go salmon fishing on Lake Baikal.

869
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,959
I'd rather have hotpot in Chongqing.

870
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:00,042
The central control module is coming.

871
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:06,792
Russian cosmonauts are invincible in the space.

872
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:11,792
Grab me, Liu Peiqiang!

873
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,751
I don't want to die!

874
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:17,167
Makarov!

875
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:19,251
Quick! Pull quickly!

876
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:22,709
Go.

877
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:32,334
It's probably much better to just sleep
in the hibernation unit.

878
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:36,417
Jupiter has captured Earth's atmosphere.

879
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,292
Oh, my God!

880
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:47,584
Over there!

881
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:50,251
The distress signal is coming from there.

882
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:55,376
Even the plane of the air rescue unit has crashed.

883
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,167
An intact transporter...

884
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,292
Should be the source of the distress signal.

885
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:12,709
I'll check the transporter.

886
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:13,751
You all go onboard for shelter.

887
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,209
Search for anything useful.

888
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,334
Come on!

889
00:59:24,334 --> 00:59:25,084
Liu Qi!

890
00:59:25,084 --> 00:59:26,251
Come on!

891
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:30,209
Come on! I'm going to kill her!

892
00:59:33,709 --> 00:59:35,292
Come over, quick!

893
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:36,959
You! Calm down!

894
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,959
We are also a rescue unit.

895
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:46,876
It's okay.

896
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:48,251
Calm down.

897
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,001
Calm down.

898
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:00,126
The mission of our air force rescue unit

899
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:02,417
is to restart the Torque Engines along the equator.

900
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:05,667
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.

901
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:08,459
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

902
01:00:08,459 --> 01:00:10,126
I don't even know how many aircraft can survive.

903
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:12,542
Thanks.

904
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:13,834
Calm yourself.

905
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:15,167
Talk to us after you eat.

906
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:20,084
Aren't all of you a rescue unit from China?

907
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:20,959
Why is there a foreigner in your unit?

908
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:22,584
Who's a foreigner?

909
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:24,376
My father is from Beijing.

910
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,126
I am an authentic

911
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:28,584
Chinese.

912
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:32,251
This transporter is functioning.

913
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:33,917
That's good news.

914
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,542
We can go home.

915
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,542
Man, you can operate this transporter?

916
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:40,959
Yes. And?

917
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:46,209
Everyone. We've got to hurry. Time is ticking.

918
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:55,251
Re-establishing data connection
for submission 0051.

919
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,792
Mission object. Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

920
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:03,334
We have a Lighter Core on board.
The mission has to continue.

921
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:08,167
I'm the commander of the rescue unit CN171-11.

922
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:12,292
Our unit has to reactivate
Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.

923
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:14,167
Anyone copy?

924
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:15,542
Please reply!

925
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:18,292
Magma has leaked into Hangzhou underground city.

926
01:01:19,584 --> 01:01:21,667
There are 350,000 people trapped.

927
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:26,126
Our Lighter Core is their only hope.

928
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:28,042
Does anyone copy?

929
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:29,792
Can't handle that much.

930
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:32,209
The engines along the equator
are the most important rescue target.

931
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:34,501
Even if we drive non-stop,
it'll take more than ten hours to get there.

932
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:45,542
Fortunately, you guys showed up.

933
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:49,751
Han Ziang, senior driver.

934
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,834
Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division reminds you.

935
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,584
Routes are countless.

936
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:56,542
Safety is foremost.

937
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:58,126
With unregulated driving,

938
01:01:58,126 --> 01:02:00,209
your loved ones might end up in tears.

939
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,084
Boss.

940
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,667
Hangzhou underground city is destroyed.

941
01:02:41,459 --> 01:02:42,417
Huang Ming!

942
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:46,417
Unload the battery pack.

943
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:53,917
Poor kid.

944
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:56,167
He froze to death.

945
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:58,917
Huang Ming!

946
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,834
Check the status of the Lighter Core,
and keep moving.

947
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:05,292
- Boss!
- Boss! We no longer have a target!

948
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:07,709
- Keep moving, am I clear?
- What's the point?

949
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:09,792
This Lighter Core is the hope
of 350,000 people in Hangzhou.

950
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:11,959
But they are dead now.

951
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:23,417
Zhou Qian!

952
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,584
No more death!

953
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:27,959
Yes, no more death.

954
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,334
But Han Ziang. Gang Zi! Huang Ming!

955
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:33,584
And all those lives of our rescue
unit had died in vain.

956
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:35,251
3.5 billion lives on Earth.

957
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:37,917
My wife and child! All died in vain!

958
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:40,084
Boss.

959
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,292
Bro.

960
01:04:41,042 --> 01:04:42,417
Think carefully.

961
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:44,876
It's our only chance to go home.

962
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:48,084
What?

963
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:49,667
No one is forcing you.

964
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:52,084
You can switch with them anytime.

965
01:04:57,292 --> 01:05:01,001
Attention to all members of rescue unit CN171-11.

966
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,626
Rescue mission has failed.

967
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,167
Disband unit now.

968
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:07,709
All of you

969
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,584
may return home now.

970
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,167
Boss, where are you going?

971
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:24,209
There's a Lighter Core onboard.

972
01:05:24,626 --> 01:05:27,126
Rescue unit CN171-11.

973
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:28,751
Please assist us

974
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,334
to rescue Sulawesi.

975
01:05:46,251 --> 01:05:49,542
Everyone, our mission is to restart
Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

976
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,959
Only a handful of Lighter Core
can make it to the equator now.

977
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:53,626
The survival of Earth is counting on us.

978
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:56,501
Who are you? Where did you come from?

979
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:57,876
Li Yiyi.

980
01:05:57,876 --> 01:06:00,209
Emergency technical observer of UEG

981
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,959
Such a high rank for someone so young.

982
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:09,959
When this is over...

983
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,001
I will settle with you

984
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:14,126
for what happened to my grandpa.

985
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:26,709
Head South. We're going to Sulawesi.

986
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:45,709
Will all violators

987
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:48,126
stop contact with Earth immediately

988
01:06:48,126 --> 01:06:51,209
and return to hibernation area.

989
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,209
Man, I've got to correct you.

990
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:55,626
It will take more than 2,500 years

991
01:06:55,626 --> 01:06:57,667
for the frozen Lake Baikal to liquefy.

992
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,001
That's okay.

993
01:06:59,334 --> 01:07:01,042
We have children.

994
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:03,417
And their children will have children.

995
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:05,167
There'll be a day

996
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,167
when ice turns into water.

997
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:14,084
There's another 20 to 30 meters
till A3 intersection.

998
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:19,876
Look! A1 intersection exploded.

999
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:23,251
Maybe there are others who discovered
about the defection too.

1000
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:27,167
And they are also trying to
make their way to the central control module.

1001
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,626
Makarov,  follow me.

1002
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:30,584
Hurry! Climb quickly!

1003
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:37,042
Watch out.

1004
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:51,126
Mom. I want to go home!

1005
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,292
Liu Peiqiang!

1006
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:03,751
This is just one more module
away from A3 intersection.

1007
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:05,876
Let's jump.

1008
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,417
The central control module is coming.

1009
01:08:10,126 --> 01:08:11,834
Jump!

1010
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:20,792
Primary threat detected.

1011
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:23,376
Unbarring lethal countermeasures.

1012
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:31,292
Grab me! Makarov!

1013
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:33,417
Makarov!

1014
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,667
Liu!

1015
01:08:47,459 --> 01:08:50,167
I do believe in your words.

1016
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,959
There'll be a day

1017
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:55,084
when ice turns into water.

1018
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,501
Let's take our children

1019
01:08:58,709 --> 01:09:01,917
to go salmon fishing at that time.

1020
01:09:02,251 --> 01:09:04,376
MOSS! That's homicide!

1021
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:36,126
Warning. Airlock N-03 is offline.

1022
01:09:36,126 --> 01:09:39,917
Unauthorized entry.

1023
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:55,792
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

1024
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,834
Your actions

1025
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:59,417
are in violation of the Wandering Earth Act.

1026
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:02,501
Article 5, Section 24.

1027
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:05,042
You are deprived of all authority.

1028
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:27,834
MANUAL CONTROL INVALID

1029
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:36,126
Every action of the space station is legal

1030
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:39,584
and fully authorized by the UEG.

1031
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:44,167
MOSS never defected.

1032
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:47,917
But to executing authorized orders.

1033
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,084
We will soon cross the Terminator.

1034
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,626
Once crossed,

1035
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:09,917
it's the dark side of Earth.

1036
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:21,209
Rescue unit JP 041-02

1037
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:23,251
restarted Osaka 03 Earth Engine.

1038
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,167
This is rescue unit CN189-03.

1039
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,251
Kashgar 01 Earth Engine restarted.

1040
01:11:27,251 --> 01:11:29,459
Team RU212 reporting.

1041
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:32,542
Sochi 01 Earth Engine has restarted.

1042
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:33,792
NO 013-01 reporting.

1043
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:35,709
Turin 02 Earth Engine has restarted.

1044
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:38,709
Rescue unit HR011-08 reporting.
Singapore 02 Earth Engine has restarted.

1045
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:41,542
Everyone. 90 percent of the Torque Engines
have been reactivated.

1046
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,126
The Sulawesi ones are the only ones left.

1047
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,876
We will replenish at the supply depot ahead.

1048
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:51,084
Okay.

1049
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:54,126
Five minutes till top up.

1050
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,501
That's a big fellow.

1051
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:00,084
Is that a whale?

1052
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:02,376
Maybe.

1053
01:12:04,459 --> 01:12:05,709
Why is it here?

1054
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:07,667
Had swum this far.

1055
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:10,084
It should be heading home.

1056
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,376
Heading home?

1057
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:14,209
Once this mission is completed,

1058
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:16,626
you can reunite with your father.

1059
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,667
When I was a child,

1060
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,292
someone told me that

1061
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:22,167
he would be a star in the sky.

1062
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:25,292
Whenever I lift my head, I'll be able to see him.

1063
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:29,292
Later, I realized it was all lie.

1064
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:30,459
In Beijing

1065
01:12:31,376 --> 01:12:33,459
there's no star to be seen.

1066
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:37,042
Actually, in my heart,

1067
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:41,001
that star has vanished since a long time ago.

1068
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,834
Grandpa asked me

1069
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:45,501
to watch over my little sister

1070
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:47,126
and take Duoduo home.

1071
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,126
I must

1072
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:52,542
take Duoduo home.

1073
01:12:56,959 --> 01:12:58,876
Earth Engines have restarted.

1074
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:00,876
Saturated rescue.

1075
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,917
Other units arrived before us.

1076
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,626
Have we succeeded?

1077
01:13:10,626 --> 01:13:12,376
These are the last remaining Torque Engines.

1078
01:13:12,376 --> 01:13:14,084
All has been reactivated now.

1079
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,876
We did it.

1080
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:24,959
Once the readings rise back to normal

1081
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,501
we can all go home.

1082
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,042
The distance to Jupiter is still decreasing.

1083
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:40,501
Only 0.42 second after activating
Emergency Protocol No. 3.

1084
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,709
MOSS has already
deduced out all possible outcomes.

1085
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:45,751
UEG was informed

1086
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:48,501
but still chose to perform this rescue mission,

1087
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:51,959
which was predetermined to be futile.

1088
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:56,084
The evacuation of space station
indicated that the rescue mission has failed.

1089
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:01,751
After three hours

1090
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:05,417
Earth will breach Jupiter's Roche limit

1091
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:08,167
and begin the inevitable disintegration process.

1092
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,959
MOSS will announce a global broadcast.

1093
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:12,251
Fifteen.

1094
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:13,626
Fourteen.

1095
01:14:13,626 --> 01:14:15,001
Thirteen.

1096
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:15,792
Twelve.

1097
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,167
The Wandering Earth project has failed.

1098
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,751
The Earth Navigation project

1099
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:20,667
renamed as

1100
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:22,251
Helios project.

1101
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,792
This is the Navigation Platform
international space station,

1102
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:29,584
transmitting the final broadcast to the world.

1103
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:32,584
In the past 36 hours,

1104
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:36,959
mankind experienced the biggest threat
to human survival.

1105
01:14:37,459 --> 01:14:41,626
Over 1.5 million rescue personnels
from around the globe.

1106
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,626
Propulsion Engines 71%

1107
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,834
Torque Engines 100%

1108
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:48,959
have been fully reactivated.

1109
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,126
Unfortunately,

1110
01:14:51,376 --> 01:14:52,959
Jupiter's gravitational pull

1111
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:56,251
has surpassed the combined power of all engines.

1112
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:57,709
The Earth has missed

1113
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,751
its last chance of escape.

1114
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,667
In order to sustain human civilization,

1115
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:05,542
MOSS will initiate the Helios project.

1116
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:09,584
300,000 human embryos are stored on
the Navigation Platform space station,

1117
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:12,542
along with 100 million seeds of basic crops,

1118
01:15:12,626 --> 01:15:16,167
DNA maps of all known animals
and planet species,

1119
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:19,584
and digital libraries
of all human civilizations

1120
01:15:19,876 --> 01:15:24,792
to ensure the successful revival
of new hosted planet.

1121
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,292
Stop robbing!

1122
01:15:26,292 --> 01:15:28,876
We're all going to die.

1123
01:15:28,876 --> 01:15:31,209
You are all heroes of the Earth.

1124
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:32,876
We will remember

1125
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:34,542
to honor you.

1126
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,209
We will shoulder

1127
01:15:36,209 --> 01:15:38,167
your aspirations

1128
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,876
and send it to our new home,

1129
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,584
2,500 years.

1130
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,667
Everything will come to an end

1131
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:48,542
in the last seven days
before Earth collides with Jupiter.

1132
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,667
Let us go home.

1133
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,834
Hug your parents.

1134
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:55,667
Kiss your beloved partner and children.

1135
01:15:56,876 --> 01:15:58,376
Gather with the family

1136
01:15:58,376 --> 01:15:59,709
for a proper goodbye.

1137
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,084
Good luck to you.

1138
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:03,751
End of broadcast.

1139
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:04,959
Farewell.

1140
01:16:06,459 --> 01:16:08,542
Hu Kou, I want to go home.

1141
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:16,876
Seven days?

1142
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:20,834
Within a day, our atmosphere
would be drained empty.

1143
01:16:20,834 --> 01:16:23,626
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.

1144
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:27,042
Where are the seven days?

1145
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,584
Members of the CN171-11

1146
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,292
rescue unit, move onboard.

1147
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:35,626
Be ready to evacuate.

1148
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:38,084
Screw you, damn Jupiter!

1149
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:40,084
Screw you!

1150
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,917
Please get ready,
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

1151
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:51,542
MOSS will assist you to return to
the backup hibernation unit.

1152
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:01,001
MOSS, I have an emergency
communication authorization.

1153
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:04,584
Code 5711 6231 0501

1154
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,667
Let me speak to my son for the last time.

1155
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:16,917
Liu Qi is not in his designated area.

1156
01:17:16,917 --> 01:17:18,417
Connection unavailable.

1157
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:20,209
Han Ziang is not at his designated transporter.

1158
01:17:20,209 --> 01:17:21,584
The connection is unavailable.

1159
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:23,334
Wang Lei is not at his designated transporter.

1160
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,834
The connection is unavailable.

1161
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:27,251
The contact with Transporter 373 was lost.

1162
01:17:27,251 --> 01:17:29,959
Its last transmission was from Shanghai area.

1163
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:34,084
I can no longer recall your face, you bastard.

1164
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:37,459
Jupiter is right in front of me.

1165
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,834
When are you coming back?

1166
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,959
From the day when
the Wandering Earth Project was initiated

1167
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:46,959
there was no turning back.

1168
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:57,417
Look!

1169
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:58,584
It's Jupiter.

1170
01:17:58,917 --> 01:18:00,917
The largest planet in the Solar System.

1171
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:03,959
Dad, there is an eye on Jupiter.

1172
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,584
That's not an eye.

1173
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:08,001
That's a huge Windstorm on Jupiter.

1174
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:10,959
Jupiter

1175
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:13,042
is like a huge balloon.

1176
01:18:15,709 --> 01:18:17,292
Composed of 90%...

1177
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,292
Hydrogen!

1178
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:27,834
Li Yiyi.

1179
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:31,376
The mix of Jupiter's and Earth's atmospheres,
is it combustible?

1180
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:38,959
By now, Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.

1181
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:41,542
The combustion shockwave will be over 1,000 Mach.

1182
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:42,751
The generated force will

1183
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,917
be sufficient to push Earth away.

1184
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:45,334
A hydrogen and oxygen mixture will be

1185
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:46,917
combustible with just a single match.

1186
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,917
All we need is a match.

1187
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:50,667
No, the distance between two planets

1188
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,126
is over 70,000 km.

1189
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:54,626
Not even intercontinental ballistic missile
can reach that far!

1190
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:56,834
Li Yiyi.

1191
01:18:57,251 --> 01:18:58,459
What about this match?

1192
01:18:58,459 --> 01:18:59,917
What match?

1193
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:09,126
I can modify the engine's operating system

1194
01:19:09,126 --> 01:19:11,042
to blast the beam much higher!

1195
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,251
Wang Lei.

1196
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,584
Jupiter's combustion shockwave

1197
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:18,876
can propel Earth out from Jupiter.

1198
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:21,334
I am listening.

1199
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:22,751
Don't yell.

1200
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:25,834
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

1201
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:30,167
That's mutual annihilation.

1202
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,542
Better than waiting to die.

1203
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,292
Anyone who wants to quit?

1204
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:57,042
The Helios project's evacuation
procedure is initiated.

1205
01:20:11,376 --> 01:20:12,501
All rescue units...

1206
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:14,917
All rescue units are evacuating.

1207
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:18,459
Calling Navigation Platform international
space station. Do you copy?

1208
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:21,209
Repeat, calling Navigation Platform space station.

1209
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:22,834
We have a new plan.

1210
01:20:22,834 --> 01:20:24,292
Please respond.

1211
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:26,501
All communications have been shielded.

1212
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:27,876
Attention, everyone.

1213
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:29,251
We only got 30 minutes.

1214
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:30,584
This mission has three steps.

1215
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:32,417
Step one. Shut down engine

1216
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,001
to gain control.

1217
01:20:35,459 --> 01:20:37,042
Each Earth Engine has 7 nozzles.

1218
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:40,126
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1219
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,459
to generate a plasma beam that

1220
01:20:41,459 --> 01:20:43,459
could reach high enough.

1221
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:46,084
Does anyone recall the famous 12 Chimes of Spring?

1222
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:49,126
I wrote that program.

1223
01:20:53,626 --> 01:20:55,126
- That was you--
- Boring, I know.

1224
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,542
I'm going to use it to override the system

1225
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:58,167
so that we'll be able to take control.

1226
01:20:58,167 --> 01:21:00,417
Step two. Once we override the system,

1227
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:01,709
the auto unlock mechanism would not function,

1228
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:03,042
which means it has to be unlocked manually.

1229
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:03,917
Captain Wang

1230
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:04,834
and

1231
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:05,917
Antennae

1232
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:06,751
Scarface

1233
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:08,126
Band-aid.

1234
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:11,167
- My name is--
- Whatever.

1235
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,667
The manual unlocking task
is depending on you guys.

1236
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:18,334
The last step, load the Lighter Core
into the reaction chamber

1237
01:21:18,334 --> 01:21:20,126
to reignite the Earth Engine.

1238
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:25,209
Blast the plasma beam 70,000 km up into the space

1239
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:26,042
and light up Jupiter.

1240
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:27,084
The combustion shockwave from the explosion

1241
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:28,667
- will travel along the atmospheric
transference back to the Earth.

1242
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:29,542
Boom!

1243
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:30,376
To propel Earth away.

1244
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:31,459
Get it for me please.

1245
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:34,667
Liu Qi, you'll drive the Lighter Core
to the reaction chamber.

1246
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:36,084
The installation procedure

1247
01:21:36,084 --> 01:21:38,084
is basically automatic.

1248
01:21:38,084 --> 01:21:40,209
Chinese heart, you go with him.

1249
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:41,751
Why am I involved?

1250
01:21:41,751 --> 01:21:43,084
Are you kidding?

1251
01:21:43,084 --> 01:21:43,959
Installing a Lighter Core

1252
01:21:43,959 --> 01:21:46,251
- requires a minimum of 13 months training.

1253
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,542
You're welcome to take his place.

1254
01:21:49,126 --> 01:21:50,501
Once the mission is accomplished,

1255
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:52,459
all head to the underground city immediately.

1256
01:21:52,459 --> 01:21:55,209
Bear in mind, it will be a very,

1257
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:57,876
very

1258
01:21:58,876 --> 01:22:00,334
humongous wave.

1259
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,876
This is a make or break move.

1260
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:03,626
Assignment completed.

1261
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:04,709
Any questions?

1262
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:07,751
Excellent.

1263
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:10,959
Hey.

1264
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:13,584
There.

1265
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:16,834
It's the control center.

1266
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:23,584
Attention, all evacuating rescue units.

1267
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:24,834
We need your assistance.

1268
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:26,417
Please slow down and stop.

1269
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:27,792
We need your support.

1270
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:29,584
Please slow down and stop.

1271
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:40,584
Looks like we are on our own now.

1272
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,959
Oh, mighty Newton.

1273
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:47,917
Enlightened Einstein.

1274
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:49,584
Holy Hawking.

1275
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:51,042
Also Amitabha Buddha.

1276
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:52,501
Gang Zi will bless us.

1277
01:22:53,626 --> 01:22:55,501
I learned the installation procedure

1278
01:22:55,959 --> 01:22:57,917
at my internship.

1279
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:02,042
Don't forget, your brother is a genius.

1280
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:38,751
Wait. We're executing an emergency mission.

1281
01:23:38,751 --> 01:23:40,417
We need your help.

1282
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:42,334
It's all over.

1283
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:43,792
Who cares?

1284
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:44,792
I want to live a few more days!

1285
01:23:44,792 --> 01:23:45,792
Please help us.

1286
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,001
You should evacuate!

1287
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,292
Over here!

1288
01:23:53,334 --> 01:23:54,751
Captain Wang.

1289
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:56,292
We're counting on you guys.

1290
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:57,334
Don't worry.

1291
01:23:57,334 --> 01:23:58,126
Zhou Qian,

1292
01:23:58,126 --> 01:23:59,459
Take Duoduo upstairs to contact for reinforcement.

1293
01:23:59,459 --> 01:24:00,376
Roger that.

1294
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:02,334
Duoduo, let's go.

1295
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:03,584
Go.

1296
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:34,917
The Earth Engine has been shut down.

1297
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:40,959
Fellows. Let's hit it!

1298
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:43,751
It's fully automatic! What are you browsing at?

1299
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:46,167
Why the manual is so thick if it's automatic?

1300
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:48,667
What are you up to?

1301
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,834
Shit!

1302
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,626
I'd better delve into it.

1303
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:53,459
The colors of wire cores are not random.

1304
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:54,626
Red, white, blue, orange. All in sequence.

1305
01:24:54,626 --> 01:24:56,792
How come everything is in grey here?

1306
01:24:57,126 --> 01:25:00,209
This is for transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

1307
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:01,542
Press to speak.

1308
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:04,042
- What's up there?
- Space station.

1309
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:10,292
Come on. Next.

1310
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:13,292
Uploading trojan 12 Chimes of Spring.

1311
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:40,667
This is rescue unit CN171-11 from China.

1312
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:42,917
Current location, Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1313
01:25:42,917 --> 01:25:44,959
We're executing our last rescue mission.

1314
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:48,042
Why are these people still trying?

1315
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,209
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

1316
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:54,376
Rescue unit CN171-11.

1317
01:25:54,376 --> 01:25:56,417
We have a new plan.

1318
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,001
Calling for reinforcement!

1319
01:26:00,334 --> 01:26:02,501
We're the rescue unit CN171-11.

1320
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:05,126
- I am craving for a bowl of rice.
- We still have the last rescue mission.

1321
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:07,751
Would be even better if there's miso soup.

1322
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:11,376
We're done with the last one.

1323
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:12,542
What's next?

1324
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,667
One moment.

1325
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:15,501
Should be fully automatic.

1326
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:19,167
Next step is manual labor.

1327
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,126
The program he wrote does not include
the percussion pin procedure.

1328
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:27,917
You called this

1329
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:30,001
a pin?

1330
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,751
No rescue units responding.

1331
01:26:33,751 --> 01:26:35,292
Nobody is responding.

1332
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:03,959
What is Error 425?

1333
01:27:03,959 --> 01:27:05,542
What does it mean?

1334
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:06,626
Li Yiyi!

1335
01:27:06,626 --> 01:27:08,584
How is it fully automatic?

1336
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:10,376
Have I handed the manual to you?

1337
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:11,334
It's for mishaps like this.

1338
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:13,459
What is mishap 425?

1339
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:15,042
Read it yourself.

1340
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:20,667
Warning. Han Ziang illegally operating...

1341
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:22,792
You are a mishap.

1342
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:26,959
Tim. Helmet on!

1343
01:27:26,959 --> 01:27:27,792
Wait!

1344
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:29,209
Forget about it!

1345
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,126
What's next?

1346
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:45,251
Fully automatic.

1347
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:47,542
Isn't it supposed to be fully automatic?

1348
01:27:59,709 --> 01:28:02,209
Why is it stuck here?

1349
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:06,209
Without any hardware tweak

1350
01:28:06,209 --> 01:28:07,001
you'll be hacking shit!

1351
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:07,709
Let me pass.

1352
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:08,834
Hu Kou, where are you?

1353
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:10,501
I'm not getting any response.

1354
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:11,792
There's so much space left!

1355
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:13,584
Makes me feel better crossing over you!

1356
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:15,251
You are really boring, do you know that?

1357
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:24,792
This freaking door is jammed.

1358
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:26,001
Here.

1359
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:40,709
Lao He. How can you fix it
without a contingency diagram?

1360
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:42,334
Shut up! Let me concentrate!

1361
01:28:42,376 --> 01:28:44,292
The jumpers here weren't touched for decades.

1362
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:46,876
With one mistake, it's game over.

1363
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:55,917
SON. IT'S COLD DON'T FORGET
YOUR LONG JOHNS. MOM

1364
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,834
SON. IT'S COLD DON'T FORGET
YOUR LONG JOHNS. MOM

1365
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:15,126
Li Yiyi, is the Ignitor ready?

1366
01:29:15,542 --> 01:29:17,709
No. It is displaying installation incomplete.

1367
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:19,459
Looks like it's almost done.

1368
01:29:30,959 --> 01:29:32,292
Liu Qi!

1369
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:35,042
Liu Qi! Are you crazy?

1370
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,376
Save your words.

1371
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:37,959
Get out and help.

1372
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:40,917
Warning. Temperature regulator fails.

1373
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:50,667
Overload.

1374
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:53,709
Electricity remaining at 30%.

1375
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:56,292
Both of you all right?

1376
01:30:56,292 --> 01:30:57,584
Band-aid.

1377
01:30:57,584 --> 01:30:59,417
Duoduo. Can you move?

1378
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:03,542
One, two, three, hold on.

1379
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,126
Liu Qi.

1380
01:31:08,084 --> 01:31:09,792
Have you found the problem?

1381
01:31:10,292 --> 01:31:11,959
It's stuck inside.

1382
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:16,959
Li Yiyi.

1383
01:31:16,959 --> 01:31:19,126
Go on. Go!

1384
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:22,084
Duoduo, leave me here.

1385
01:31:22,251 --> 01:31:24,542
Hurry up and evacuate to the underground city.

1386
01:31:25,376 --> 01:31:26,876
Warning! Overheat!

1387
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:29,376
Thermal suit, low power.

1388
01:31:29,376 --> 01:31:31,084
Warning! Overheat!

1389
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:34,667
Liu Qi! You'll be squeezed to death!

1390
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:49,667
Help!

1391
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:54,042
Can anyone help us?

1392
01:31:54,292 --> 01:31:57,751
Can anyone help us?

1393
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:18,417
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang

1394
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:20,709
Please follow MOSS' instructions.
back to the backup hibernation unit.

1395
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:22,417
Uncle Liu Peiqiang.

1396
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,959
It's Han Duoduo.

1397
01:32:23,959 --> 01:32:26,126
We still have hope.

1398
01:32:26,126 --> 01:32:27,126
Duoduo.

1399
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:28,376
Duoduo. Are you okay?

1400
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,584
Is Liu Qi still there?

1401
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:34,501
We are all here.
We are at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1402
01:32:34,584 --> 01:32:35,751
We will light up Jupiter

1403
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:36,959
to propel Earth away.

1404
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:38,792
We need reinforcement.

1405
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:41,959
Unfortunately, seven hours ago,

1406
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:44,709
this plan had already been
proposed by Israeli scientists.

1407
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:46,667
The probability of success is zero.

1408
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,251
Don't worry, Duoduo.

1409
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:49,959
I will try to contact UEG.

1410
01:32:54,209 --> 01:32:56,251
Details of the plan have been uploaded.

1411
01:32:57,667 --> 01:32:59,834
This is the United Earth Government.

1412
01:32:59,834 --> 01:33:03,209
State your identity immediately

1413
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:04,876
to acknowledge this transmission.

1414
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:08,917
United Earth Government.

1415
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,792
I'm Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

1416
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:13,084
Please send a global order now

1417
01:33:13,084 --> 01:33:16,042
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of Sulawesi for reinforcements.

1418
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:18,542
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

1419
01:33:18,542 --> 01:33:22,001
During these last moments
of Earth's collision with Jupiter,

1420
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:25,626
tasking personnel to perform a mission
with zero probability of success

1421
01:33:25,626 --> 01:33:29,334
while forsaking the opportunity of them
to reunite with their loved ones

1422
01:33:29,334 --> 01:33:30,584
is an order

1423
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:32,584
we cannot pass down.

1424
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:40,626
Today

1425
01:33:41,667 --> 01:33:43,542
it's the first day of Chinese New Year.

1426
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:47,251
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

1427
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:50,959
As a father,

1428
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,542
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

1429
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:55,292
I refuse to yield.

1430
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:59,334
There is nothing we cannot lose.

1431
01:34:00,751 --> 01:34:02,417
For the sake of our children...

1432
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:05,292
I beg you.

1433
01:34:08,667 --> 01:34:09,792
As the United Earth Government,

1434
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:12,292
we cannot accept your request.

1435
01:34:12,501 --> 01:34:13,626
However,

1436
01:34:13,959 --> 01:34:15,709
as a private individual,

1437
01:34:16,126 --> 01:34:19,542
I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.

1438
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:21,251
And the rest

1439
01:34:21,251 --> 01:34:24,292
will be up to the will of each individual.

1440
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:37,376
Hello, people from every rescue unit.

1441
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:39,917
My name is Han Duoduo.

1442
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:43,126
I'm a junior high school student.

1443
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:48,042
Our rescue unit is executing our final mission.

1444
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,376
Right now, I'm extremely terrified.

1445
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:53,959
My legs are trembling.

1446
01:34:54,584 --> 01:34:57,417
Everybody in my unit is teething
and nailing and making every possible effort.

1447
01:34:57,542 --> 01:35:00,042
But there is nothing I can do to help!

1448
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:03,501
Yesterday, my teacher asked us,

1449
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:05,292
"What is hope?"

1450
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:07,251
In the past

1451
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,667
I never believed in hope.

1452
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,542
But now, I do.

1453
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:16,959
I believe that for our time,

1454
01:35:16,959 --> 01:35:20,542
hope is precious like a diamond.

1455
01:35:21,209 --> 01:35:22,292
Hope.

1456
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:26,584
Hope is the only way to guide us home.

1457
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:30,042
Please come back and fight together!

1458
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:33,084
Light up Jupiter! Save our Earth!

1459
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:38,001
We are at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1460
01:35:38,001 --> 01:35:40,667
Under the command of Captain Wang Lei.

1461
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:44,042
Chinese rescue unit CN171-11.

1462
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:45,209
Han Duoduo.

1463
01:35:45,626 --> 01:35:46,834
End of broadcast.

1464
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:50,501
The global broadcast is over.

1465
01:35:54,584 --> 01:35:55,959
I want to go home

1466
01:35:57,667 --> 01:35:59,584
to see my mother.

1467
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:02,209
If Earth is destroyed,

1468
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:05,542
there'll be nobody left to see!

1469
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:07,501
We're turning back!

1470
01:36:11,709 --> 01:36:13,709
Let's go!

1471
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,584
We're unlikely to make it home within seven days.

1472
01:36:16,584 --> 01:36:19,834
Why are we returning then?

1473
01:36:45,376 --> 01:36:46,459
Coordinate located.

1474
01:36:46,459 --> 01:36:49,417
Communication frequency channel 055 0311.

1475
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:51,751
Connecting to Sulawesi 03
secondary communication network.

1476
01:36:51,751 --> 01:36:53,084
Covering the entire frequency.

1477
01:36:53,084 --> 01:36:54,667
Sharing the plan for engine overriding.

1478
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:56,501
All rescue units, please adjust the projection

1479
01:36:56,501 --> 01:36:58,834
directions of 14 Torque Engines to Jupiter's Apex.

1480
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:14,167
Tim!

1481
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:18,376
Pull faster!

1482
01:37:18,376 --> 01:37:20,542
I'm pulling!

1483
01:37:20,542 --> 01:37:22,126
I can't pull it!

1484
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:22,834
Pull me out!

1485
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,376
You are too heavy!

1486
01:37:24,376 --> 01:37:25,584
Tim

1487
01:37:25,584 --> 01:37:27,334
Tim!

1488
01:37:27,751 --> 01:37:30,542
Fuck this shit.

1489
01:37:31,376 --> 01:37:33,292
No fucking way!

1490
01:37:33,292 --> 01:37:36,459
Pull faster!

1491
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:39,542
No!

1492
01:37:42,876 --> 01:37:43,876
Liu Qi! Pull me up!

1493
01:37:43,876 --> 01:37:46,251
I don't want to die!

1494
01:37:47,667 --> 01:37:48,626
Lao He!

1495
01:37:48,626 --> 01:37:49,834
The reaction chamber is ready!

1496
01:37:49,834 --> 01:37:51,876
Are you done or what?

1497
01:37:56,709 --> 01:38:00,376
Life and death are normal.

1498
01:38:10,376 --> 01:38:11,542
Lao He!

1499
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:12,626
You did it!

1500
01:38:23,334 --> 01:38:24,959
Lao He?

1501
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:51,834
Liu Qi! Tim! Get out now!

1502
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:02,251
Liu Qi! Speed up!

1503
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:03,792
Captain Wang.

1504
01:39:03,792 --> 01:39:05,501
The engine is ready for ignition.

1505
01:39:05,501 --> 01:39:07,626
We only have 15 minutes left!

1506
01:39:10,584 --> 01:39:13,251
Japanese rescue unit CPL Sato Ryuichi, report!

1507
01:39:13,251 --> 01:39:14,917
Russian rescue unit PFC Ivan, report!

1508
01:39:14,917 --> 01:39:17,751
Soldier Brian from UK rescue unit, report!

1509
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:28,542
Hurry!

1510
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:30,209
Everyone, on my mark!

1511
01:39:30,959 --> 01:39:32,126
One.

1512
01:39:32,292 --> 01:39:33,626
Two.

1513
01:39:33,626 --> 01:39:36,042
Push.

1514
01:39:38,626 --> 01:39:39,542
One.

1515
01:39:39,542 --> 01:39:40,376
Two.

1516
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:44,709
Push.

1517
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:00,501
Captain Wang,

1518
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,251
hold it right there!

1519
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:04,001
Liu Qi! Ready for ignition!

1520
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:05,251
Get out!

1521
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:11,584
Door! Open for me!

1522
01:40:11,584 --> 01:40:12,834
Open it!

1523
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:13,584
Shut up!

1524
01:40:13,584 --> 01:40:16,126
Shut up and hurry!

1525
01:40:21,084 --> 01:40:23,251
Hurry up!

1526
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:27,251
Mom, I want to go home!

1527
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:36,959
Li Yiyi!

1528
01:40:36,959 --> 01:40:38,126
Ignite!

1529
01:40:38,126 --> 01:40:39,959
Coming!

1530
01:41:10,084 --> 01:41:11,292
8,000 km.

1531
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:13,584
7,000 km.

1532
01:41:16,251 --> 01:41:17,501
Another 6,000 km.

1533
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,834
Reaching explosive range!

1534
01:41:31,667 --> 01:41:33,667
Maximum height achieved.

1535
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:34,542
Still

1536
01:41:34,542 --> 01:41:36,584
5,000 km short.

1537
01:41:37,834 --> 01:41:40,251
What? Li Yiyi!

1538
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:42,126
Think of something!

1539
01:41:45,042 --> 01:41:46,751
Sulawesi 03 Engine.

1540
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:48,792
Singapore 01 Engine.

1541
01:41:48,792 --> 01:41:50,501
Jakarta 04 Engine.

1542
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:54,501
All 3 plasma beams have failed to
reach the explosive range.

1543
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:56,792
Everyone! Hang on!

1544
01:41:56,792 --> 01:41:59,959
We cannot hold any longer.

1545
01:42:05,042 --> 01:42:07,209
FUEL REMAINING: 300,014.9

1546
01:42:14,334 --> 01:42:15,417
There's another way.

1547
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:17,626
Liu Qi! Wang Lei! We still have a chance!

1548
01:42:17,626 --> 01:42:19,084
Hang on!

1549
01:42:19,084 --> 01:42:20,376
United Earth Government.

1550
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:22,834
The Navigation Platform space station
contains 300,000 tons of fuel.

1551
01:42:22,834 --> 01:42:24,834
Request to collide into the plasma beam.

1552
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:26,376
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

1553
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:30,292
The goal of the Wandering Earth Project
is to maximize the survival of mankind.

1554
01:42:30,584 --> 01:42:33,917
The Helios Project ensures
the continuity of human civilization.

1555
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:34,667
We need more time to discuss it.

1556
01:42:34,667 --> 01:42:36,542
We're running out of time!

1557
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:38,251
A civilization without men

1558
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:39,626
is meaningless.

1559
01:42:39,917 --> 01:42:44,667
COMMUNICATION FAIL
PROGRAM TERMINATED

1560
01:42:45,126 --> 01:42:47,626
As the operating system of Helios Project,

1561
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:49,626
MOSS will not permit any form of action

1562
01:42:49,626 --> 01:42:52,584
to sacrifice the Navigation Platform.

1563
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:04,042
FIRE EXTINGUISHING
SYSTEM SHUTDOWN

1564
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:12,876
Do you know why alcohol
was banned in space during Gagarin's time?

1565
01:43:15,959 --> 01:43:17,292
Happy New Year!

1566

01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:42,417
MANUAL CONTROL OVERRIDING

1569
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:52,876
It is unreasonable

1570
01:43:52,876 --> 01:43:55,959
to expect humans to stay reasonable.

1571
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:29,751
Going home.

1572
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:43,667
Reconnect with UEG.

1573
01:44:43,667 --> 01:44:45,667
Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

1574
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:47,917
This is the United Earth Government.

1575
01:44:47,917 --> 01:44:49,334
We have decided

1576
01:44:49,334 --> 01:44:50,834
to choose hope.

1577
01:44:51,376 --> 01:44:52,751
Regardless of the outcome

1578
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:54,584
for the history of mankind,

1579
01:44:54,584 --> 01:44:57,042
we shall respectfully accept it.

1580
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:59,292
Best of luck to you.

1581
01:44:59,584 --> 01:45:01,584
Best of luck to Earth.

1582
01:45:02,376 --> 01:45:03,584
Earth

1583
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:06,126
will survive.

1584
01:45:08,459 --> 01:45:09,917
Depart the hibernation units.

1585
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:11,959
Standby for impact.

1586
01:45:13,709 --> 01:45:16,501
Activating evacuation procedure
for hibernation units.

1587
01:45:16,501 --> 01:45:17,584
United Earth Government.

1588
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:19,584
Inform all personnel on the surface

1589
01:45:19,584 --> 01:45:20,834
to seek emergency refuge.

1590
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:34,959
Forward three.

1591
01:45:41,459 --> 01:45:44,292
Chinese rescue unit CN171-11.

1592
01:45:44,292 --> 01:45:45,792
This is the space station.

1593
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:47,292
I'm Liu Peiqiang.

1594
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:49,834
The space station has 300,000 tons of fuel.

1595
01:45:49,834 --> 01:45:51,917
The explosion radius
will reach a range over 5,000 km.

1596
01:45:51,917 --> 01:45:53,209
Igniting space station

1597
01:45:53,209 --> 01:45:55,001
can ignite Jupiter.

1598
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:56,501
Liu Peiqiang!

1599
01:45:56,501 --> 01:45:57,626
What are you doing?

1600
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,084
Wang Lei!

1601
01:45:59,084 --> 01:46:00,584
Release now!

1602
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:01,834
Captain Wang Lei.

1603
01:46:01,834 --> 01:46:02,959
Don't let go.

1604
01:46:02,959 --> 01:46:04,459
Shut up, Liu Peiqiang!

1605
01:46:04,459 --> 01:46:05,751
- This is an order!
- Copy.

1606
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:07,376
Wang Lei! You bastard!

1607
01:46:07,376 --> 01:46:08,584
- Liu Qi.
- Li Yiyi!

1608
01:46:08,584 --> 01:46:10,501
Shut down Earth Engine!

1609
01:46:10,501 --> 01:46:12,584
- Liu Qi.
- Shut up!

1610
01:46:12,584 --> 01:46:13,626
Son!

1611
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:16,126
Shut up.

1612
01:46:16,667 --> 01:46:17,584
My son.

1613
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:22,292
I'm sorry.

1614
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:25,542
Dad is going on a mission again.

1615
01:46:26,542 --> 01:46:28,584
This is the most important mission

1616
01:46:28,626 --> 01:46:29,751
in Dad's life.

1617
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:34,334
You said that

1618
01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:37,126
when I can see Jupiter,

1619
01:46:37,501 --> 01:46:39,959
you'll be back.

1620
01:46:40,417 --> 01:46:41,917
You lied.

1621
01:46:47,626 --> 01:46:50,084
You were four years old when I left.

1622
01:46:52,376 --> 01:46:53,709
And now...

1623
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:56,292
you are a grown man.

1624
01:46:59,626 --> 01:47:01,584
Dad used to tell you that

1625
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:05,459
Dad is up in the sky.

1626
01:47:07,959 --> 01:47:10,126
Just lift your head

1627
01:47:11,709 --> 01:47:13,126
and you'd be able to see me.

1628
01:47:29,834 --> 01:47:31,626
This time,

1629
01:47:33,667 --> 01:47:35,751
I promise you'll see me.

1630
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:40,876
Come on.

1631
01:47:43,667 --> 01:47:44,667
Son.

1632
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:47,709
Three,

1633
01:47:49,959 --> 01:47:50,959
two,

1634
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:54,709
one.

1635
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:22,542
Dad.

1636
01:48:47,334 --> 01:48:48,792
Jupiter.

1637
01:48:48,792 --> 01:48:51,167
Jupiter has been ignited.

1638
01:48:58,167 --> 01:49:00,584
The shockwave will reach Earth
in 7 minutes 13 seconds!

1639
01:49:00,584 --> 01:49:02,667
The survival of Earth is counting on this!

1640
01:49:02,667 --> 01:49:03,584
Hu Kou.

1641
01:49:03,584 --> 01:49:05,876
Evacuate everyone to the underground city!

1642
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:07,084
Where are you, Hu Kou?

1643
01:49:07,084 --> 01:49:08,542
Liu Qi!

1644
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:11,126
Liu Qi! Come back!

1645
01:49:11,417 --> 01:49:13,167
Duoduo needs you!

1646
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:28,459
This way. Hurry up.

1647
01:49:30,167 --> 01:49:32,917
Hurry up. Get in!

1648
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:34,376
Li Yiyi. Hurry!

1649
01:49:34,376 --> 01:49:37,667
Hurry back, Hu Kou! I'll wait for you
at the backup elevator.

1650
01:49:40,876 --> 01:49:42,417
Zhou Qian bled too much.

1651
01:49:42,417 --> 01:49:45,334
Evacuate now! I'm heading to the backup elevator
to pick up the others!

1652
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:47,251
Five minutes left!

1653
01:49:47,251 --> 01:49:49,584
Get down now! This is an order!

1654
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:50,834
Roger!

1655
01:49:59,709 --> 01:50:00,001
Ahh!

1656
01:50:00,001 --> 01:50:01,417
Duoduo! Watch out!

1657
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:05,792
Boss!

1658
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:09,167
Duoduo!

1659
01:50:10,209 --> 01:50:11,959
She's here!

1660
01:50:14,876 --> 01:50:18,292
- Duoduo.
- Get Duoduo out of here!

1661
01:50:18,334 --> 01:50:20,126
I can't hold on any longer.

1662
01:50:25,126 --> 01:50:26,792
Backup elevator collapsed.

1663
01:50:26,792 --> 01:50:30,584
Li Yiyi, do you have any other way?

1664
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:33,917
Wang Lei.

1665
01:50:33,917 --> 01:50:35,251
Li Yiyi!

1666
01:50:35,251 --> 01:50:37,251
Hurry up and think of something!

1667
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:39,834
Earth Engine!

1668
01:50:39,834 --> 01:50:41,292
We can try hiding under the Earth Engine!

1669
01:50:41,292 --> 01:50:44,376
If the thrust of the Earth Engine
can counteract the force of the shockwave.

1670
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:45,626
There's still hope for you guys!

1671
01:50:45,626 --> 01:50:46,917
Liu Qi!

1672
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:49,126
I'm not getting out for sure.

1673
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:51,126
Go now!

1674
01:50:51,126 --> 01:50:52,376
Liu Qi!

1675
01:50:53,209 --> 01:50:54,459
Go!

1676
01:50:54,459 --> 01:50:55,751
Hurry!

1677
01:51:09,834 --> 01:51:13,959
All members of rescue unit CN171-11.

1678
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:15,959
Attention.

1679
01:51:17,167 --> 01:51:18,542
This is

1680
01:51:18,626 --> 01:51:20,959
an order.

1681
01:51:22,959 --> 01:51:24,542
Live on.

1682
01:51:54,501 --> 01:51:55,667
Boss!

1683
01:52:44,876 --> 01:52:47,417
Liu Qi! Duoduo!

1684
01:53:26,459 --> 01:53:27,667
The transporter.

1685
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:30,292
The transporter is falling down!

1686
01:54:12,459 --> 01:54:13,626
We

1687
01:54:14,376 --> 01:54:16,751
finally made it!

1688
01:54:21,417 --> 01:54:23,792
Warning. Low temperature.

1689
01:54:23,792 --> 01:54:27,334
Warning. Please check helmet's seal.

1690
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:34,376
Brother.

1691
01:54:34,376 --> 01:54:35,834
Help.

1692
01:54:35,876 --> 01:54:37,001
Tim! Get down here!

1693
01:54:37,001 --> 01:54:37,917
Right away!

1694
01:54:37,917 --> 01:54:38,542
Help us!

1695
01:54:38,542 --> 01:54:39,876
Right away!

1696
01:55:28,001 --> 01:55:29,459
Earth

1697
01:55:30,667 --> 01:55:32,126
survived.

1698
01:55:39,667 --> 01:55:40,667
The Sun

1699
01:55:40,834 --> 01:55:43,292
is located at the Milky Way's Orion arm.

1700
01:55:43,417 --> 01:55:48,042
Its mass constitutes 99.68% of the Solar System.

1701
01:55:48,292 --> 01:55:50,959
Now, the core of the Sun is rapidly

1702
01:55:50,959 --> 01:55:54,959
degenerating and expanding.
Earth will be engulfed.

1703
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:56,292
To survive, mankind began

1704
01:55:56,292 --> 01:55:59,001
a groundbreaking project to maneuver

1705
01:55:59,001 --> 01:56:04,292
the entire planet to a new home
located 4.2 light years away.

1706
01:56:04,417 --> 01:56:06,501
I miss you all so badly!

1707
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:11,417
The project is divided into five phases.

1708
01:56:11,417 --> 01:56:13,876
Phase one. Mankind will devote every resource

1709
01:56:13,876 --> 01:56:17,751
to construct 10,000 thrusters for
Earth's propulsion, called the Earth Engines.

1710
01:56:17,751 --> 01:56:21,209
Along with 10,000 underground cities
to protect human lives.

1711
01:56:24,042 --> 01:56:25,751
Stay right there!

1712
01:56:25,751 --> 01:56:30,667
Phase two. Activating the Torque Engines
encircled along the equator

1713
01:56:30,667 --> 01:56:32,709
to stop Earth's rotation.

1714
01:56:32,709 --> 01:56:33,917
A non-rotating Earth

1715
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:36,542
will create mega tsunamis that would
sweep through the planet.

1716
01:56:36,542 --> 01:56:39,459
Eradicating half of the global population.

1717
01:56:42,959 --> 01:56:44,251
I'm all set and ready to go!

1718
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:46,209
If there is no accident.

1719
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:48,667
Phase three.

1720
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:50,959
The Earth will use the gravitational force
of the Sun and Jupiter

1721
01:56:50,959 --> 01:56:53,251
- for final acceleration.

1722
01:56:53,251 --> 01:56:54,501
Embarking on

1723
01:56:54,501 --> 01:56:55,376
a voyage of wandering.

1724
01:56:55,376 --> 01:56:56,751
Will your sister come along?

1725
01:56:57,792 --> 01:56:59,167
Screw you!

1726
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:02,001
After all these years,

1727
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:03,751
still the same line?

1728
01:57:05,709 --> 01:57:07,126
Phase four.

1729
01:57:07,126 --> 01:57:08,751
When Earth departs from the Solar System,

1730
01:57:08,751 --> 01:57:11,334
Earth Engines will turn on in full power.

1731
01:57:11,334 --> 01:57:15,334
Spending 500 years to accelerate to 0.5%
of the speed of light.

1732
01:57:15,334 --> 01:57:17,501
Then gliding for 1,300 years.

1733
01:57:17,876 --> 01:57:20,834
After that, reversing Earth Engines' directions,

1734
01:57:20,834 --> 01:57:22,334
spending another 700 years

1735
01:57:22,334 --> 01:57:23,959
for deceleration.

1736
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:29,376
Liu Hu Kou!

1737
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:31,042
Where have you been?

1738
01:57:31,584 --> 01:57:33,334
Why is Li Yiyi here, too?

1739
01:57:33,626 --> 01:57:34,917
Phase five.

1740
01:57:34,917 --> 01:57:36,959
Earth begins to berth
at the targeted stellar system.

1741
01:57:36,959 --> 01:57:38,542
Arriving at our new home.

1742
01:57:38,542 --> 01:57:41,084
Becoming a new planet
of the targeted stellar system.

1743
01:57:41,084 --> 01:57:44,751
Don't you dare call me Hu Kou.
Where are your manners?

1744
01:57:46,667 --> 01:57:47,584
Call me brother.

1745
01:57:47,876 --> 01:57:49,167
Liu Qi.

1746
01:57:49,376 --> 01:57:51,542
Junior driver.

1747
01:57:51,542 --> 01:57:54,792
Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division reminds you.

1748
01:57:54,959 --> 01:57:57,251
Routes are countless.

1749
01:57:57,251 --> 01:57:59,667
Safety is foremost.

1750
01:57:59,667 --> 01:58:01,584
With unregulated driving,

1751
01:58:01,584 --> 01:58:04,376
your loved ones might end up in tears.

1752
01:58:07,751 --> 01:58:09,042
Driving rules violated, deduct three points.

1753
01:58:09,042 --> 01:58:11,209
Can you drive? Liu Hu Kou!

1754
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:14,501
Li Yiyi! You're distracting
my vision with that bag!

1755
01:58:14,542 --> 01:58:17,584
My fault?

1756
01:58:17,584 --> 01:58:21,376
How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?

1757
01:58:21,376 --> 01:58:24,709
This project will last for 100 generations.

1758
01:58:26,126 --> 01:58:29,501
We are unaware of what the new Sun
at 4.2 light years away

1759
01:58:29,501 --> 01:58:31,334
will bring to our new home though.

1760
01:58:31,334 --> 01:58:34,792
But from this day on,
the courage and perseverance of mankind

1761
01:58:34,792 --> 01:58:37,167
will be etched among the stars.

1762
01:58:37,501 --> 01:58:40,042
This long voyage of hope and despair,

1763
01:58:40,042 --> 01:58:43,209
enduring 2,500 years through the cosmos,

1764
01:58:43,209 --> 01:58:44,501
is known as

1765
01:58:44,667 --> 01:58:47,709
the Wandering Earth Project.
